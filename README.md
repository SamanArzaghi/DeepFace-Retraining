# Part One: Training with Webcam Photos

In the first part of our customization and retraining process, we will focus on training the deep face recognition model using photos captured from a webcam. This step is crucial for adapting the model to recognize faces that are specific to our use case or environment.

We will set up a webcam to capture images of individuals within our target group. These images may vary in terms of lighting conditions, angles, and facial expressions, making the dataset diverse and representative of real-world scenarios. By training the model on these webcam-captured photos, we aim to enhance its ability to recognize individuals within our specific context, improving its accuracy and performance.

# Part Two: Training with Avengers Movie Data and Cast

In the second part of our customization and retraining process, we will leverage data from the Avengers movie series and its cast. This involves collecting images of the actors who portrayed the various characters in the movies. We will carefully curate and annotate this dataset to include high-quality images of each cast member.

By training the deep face recognition model on images of the Avengers movie cast, we can create a specialized model capable of recognizing the faces of these actors accurately. This customization can be particularly valuable if you plan to use the model for tasks related to movie analysis, fan engagement, or promotional purposes.

Overall, these two parts of customization and retraining will help us tailor the deep face recognition model to our specific needs. Part one ensures that the model can recognize individuals from our webcam-captured photos, while part two allows the model to identify and differentiate between the actors from the Avengers movies. This comprehensive approach will result in a highly specialized and accurate face recognition system for our intended applications.
